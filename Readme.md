# How to emulate a focused row


<p>This example demonstrates how to implement the "focused row" behavior, like in the GridControl, by handling the CellClick event. Please not that the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfPivotGridPivotGridControl_SelectModetopic">PivotGridControl.SelectionMode</a> property should be set to SelectMode.MultiSelection.</p>
